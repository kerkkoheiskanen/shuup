## Updating requirements

This project uses Prequ for requirements management.  To make changes to
installed packages or their versions, first install Prequ to the project
environment with::

  pip install prequ

To add/remove a requirement or update a requirement to a new version,
edit ``[prequ]`` section in ``setup.cfg`` and run::

  prequ update

This updates all ``requirements*.txt`` files and also builds new wheel
packages if needed.  Remember to commit any addition and removal of
files in the ``wheels`` directory too when committing the requirements
changes.
