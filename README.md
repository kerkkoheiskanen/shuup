## Development with this repository and Shuup

We recommend following directory structure when developing with Shuup.

```
project
    app (https://github.com/shuup/shuup-sandbox)
    var
    venv (project virtual environment if you are not using pyenv)
shuup-packages
    shuup (https://github.com/shuup/shuup)

    shuup-subscriptions (https://github.com/shuup/shuup-subscriptions)
    shuup-us-taxes (https://github.com/shuup/shuup-us-taxes)
venv (general venv which contains all "shuup-packages" installed with
`pip install -e <package>`)
```

Point of this is that you likely want to install shuup-packages with
`pip instll -e <package>` which allows editing and speeds up the
development. This also applies to your own internal packages/addons you create.

We have included "business_logic" app to this project which you can use
for small business logic changes for your project.

See `update-dev-project.sh` for updating your local virtual environment for
this kind of setup. Pass path to your "shuup-packages"-directory and the
script should take care of the rest.

If you are not seeing styles after running the server. Make sure you have
run `python setup.py build_resources` for your "shuup-packages". This is
important when in development mode.


## Updating requirements

This project uses Prequ for requirements management.  To make changes to
installed packages or their versions, first install Prequ to the project
environment with::

  pip install prequ

To add/remove a requirement or update a requirement to a new version,
edit ``[prequ]`` section in ``setup.cfg`` and run::

  prequ update

This updates all ``requirements*.txt`` files and also builds new wheel
packages if needed.  Remember to commit any addition and removal of
files in the ``wheels`` directory too when committing the requirements
changes.
